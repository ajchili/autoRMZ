# First round of training

## What was used?
For the first round of training, I used 225 samples that contained 1651 meteors.
This was then fed into a Keras implementation of frcnn that was run for 5 epochs
and was created by
[MasoudKaviani](https://github.com/MasoudKaviani/keras-frcnn).

## How long did it take?
It took roughly 12 and a half hours to run five epochs of training.

## What are the results?
Nothing was found!

## Why were these the results?
I do not know! But, it is likely caused by the small dataset.

## What can be improved?
For a the next round, including horizontally and vertically flipped roi should
increase the size and variance of the dataset.
